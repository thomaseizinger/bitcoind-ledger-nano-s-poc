# Ledger Nano S - Bitcoind PoC

This PoC uses a bitcoind watch-only wallet to track the account of a Ledger Nano S.

This allows us to sign and send transactions from the Ledger Nano S without the Ledger Live servers.

Run `./test.sh` to try it with your own wallet.
It assumes that your ledger is unlocked and the BTC app is open.
